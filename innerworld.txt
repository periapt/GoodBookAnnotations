Confessions of an atheist bore
------------------------------

apology
=======
I have to admit, and must apologize, that I am now obsessed by the question of religion. Can I clearly, and without rancour, express what is wrong with religion? Do I know what to say to someone who is asking the questions commonly associated with religion? Can I overcome the negative effects religion has had on my life, and help my children and those around me to a positive and fulfilled life?

I have tried talking to people about these issues. Unfortunately my passion, desperation even, and lack of clarity put people off -- assuming they were interested in the first place. In this respect I have found books to be a better friend. They have thought through their words with more care than any human. In return in committing my thoughts to written form, I can go back later and remove anything written out of bitterness - or that which does not withstand reflection.

So I am writing this primarily for my benefit. I probably don't have a truely original thought. However I have not found a book which I can really point to and say, that book contains everything I need to say.

my inner development
====================
My earliest philosophical thought, I must have been about five, was wondering whether other people were people were made of cardboard. Of course I meant a very sophisticated sort of cardboard. I cannot say I had this very clear, but I did reject this childhood solipsism on the basis that people were much more more interesting than cardboard.
