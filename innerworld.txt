Confessions of an atheist bore
------------------------------

apology
=======
I have to admit, and must apologize, that I am now obsessed by the question of religion. I am possibly the most stereotyped of stereotypical atheists. Can I clearly, and without rancour, express what is wrong with religion? Do I know what to say to someone who is asking the questions commonly associated with religion? Can I overcome the negative effects religion has had on my life, and help my children and those around me to a positive and fulfilled life?

I have tried talking to people about these issues. Unfortunately my passion, desperation even, and lack of clarity put people off -- assuming they were interested in the first place. In this respect I have found books to be a better friend. They have thought through their words with more care than any human. In return in committing my thoughts to written form, I can go back later and remove anything written out of bitterness - or that which does not withstand reflection.

So I am writing this primarily for my benefit. I probably don't have a truely original thought. However I have not found a book which I can really point to and say, that book contains everything I need to say.

my inner development
====================
My earliest philosophical thought - I must have been about five - was wondering whether other people were people were made of cardboard. Of course I meant a very sophisticated sort of cardboard. I cannot say I had this very clear, but I did quickly reject this childhood solipcism on the basis that people were much more interesting than cardboard and also that such a theory would make my own existence more puzzling rather than less. However such ruminations do confirm for me that a perception of the existence of a "soul" are natural and arise directly out of our experience.

My first two schools were Roman Catholic. This education clearly had a profound influence on my thinking - including the seriousness with which I took religious questions. It also burdened me with a profound sense of my sinfulness. The headmaster of my middle school would begin each Monday morning assembly, with the words "Hands up which of you were on Calvary yesterday." As my parents did not at that point go to church I felt condemned.

However this education did not seem to tether my thinking very firmly. I remember arguing with my Grandfather that there had to be a bit of truth in all religions. As I recall I arrived at this conclusion from a sort symmetry argument.
