afterlife
=========
"Welcome to the Afterlife Express, good souls." The conductor had a smart sky-blue uniform. The assorted metal crosses, stars, crescents and badges pinned to the uniformed jangled against each other as the conductor reached down and closed the door to the bus. As he straightened up again his shoulder brushed against the two large fluffy dice hanging from the rear view mirror. He smiled warmly as he looked over the passengers. "Any questions before we hit the road?"

A wave of reverant relief swept across the passengers, but a cowboy-hatted head atop a checked shirt, sporting a large "America is a Christian Nation" badge, raised itself above the crowd and said, "Yes, Sir."

"Ah, nice to see you Hardfield. What's your question?"

Hardfield drawled "See I can't help benoticing loads of the unsaved here: Catholics, Hindus, Muslims, Mormons and so on. Guess that's okay seeing as I'm a tolerant kind of guy. But I just wanted to check there ain't any of those damned Atheists here."
 
The conductor stroked his stubbled chin for a second his practised hand hiding the amused twitch in his lips. "The afterlife is tailored to the deceased's beliefs. And well Atheists don't believe in an afterlife." Hardfield sat down again and he started reciting the Bible quietly under his breath.

The conductor turned round, patted the hooded driver on the back and set his gaze on the bus station exit. The fake pearls of the bus station gates glistened slightly in the bright sunlight. The engines started up and the bus eased away from the platform.
